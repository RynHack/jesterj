The tests directory may contain three types of classes: 

1. Unit Tests: These are classes that employ Junit to perform testing of small units of code, most commonly
   individual methods. Use of Mock objects to ensure that the test only fails if the method being tested
   fails is encouraged. A small number of more integrated tests are also expected though any such test that takes
   over 0.1 seconds should be relegated to a long-running tests target. These classes should always have 
   names end in 'Test'.
   
2. Runners: These are classes that may or may not employ junit and are meant to provide a harness for 
   manual testing and exploration they are not run as part of our code coverage and do not referenced in production
   classes. These classes should have names that end in 'Runner'.
   
3. Test Base: Abstract classes that provide common functionality for Unit tests and/or Runners. These
   classes should have names that end in 'TestBase'.
   
In general support classes (map keys, etc) should be implemented as static inner classes, anonymous classes 
or lambda expressions.
